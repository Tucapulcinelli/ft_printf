# ft_printf

## Introduction

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions in C. The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.

## Inside my head

When I first look at pdf, I was so happy that I finally could stop use write in my functions, that I didn't realize the real size of this function and all its features.

It was only when I started to understand the flags that it became real and I realized that I should start filtering results.

I started simple, just printing a character (char), when it was working I started handle % specifiers. Hope help you to understand better.
